Gamerules:
The aim of Black Jack, which is played against the bank, is to acquire a total card value as close as possible to 21, without exceeding it. 
To determine this count, the player must remember that cards from two to nine take their original number value while tens, jacks, queens and kings count ten each.
Aces at the player's option count as 1 or 11. First the dealer deals two cards to each of the players and one card to the the bank, then the player may stand to refuse 
other cards or hit to receive another card to improve their count. If the player goes over 21 (busts) they automatically loses. If the player stands the
dealer will give themselves a card or more according to the rules. However the dealer is obliged to give themselves a card if their count totals to 16 or less, 
while they must stand if the count totals 17 or more. If the players first two card are a ten or a court card (jacks, queens and kings) and an ace,
the player has Black Jack. A player has 21 if the 21 is obtaiend with three or more cards. When the dealer has Black Jack all players lose their bets
except the players who also have a Black Jack, as the bet is called of in other words no one loses or wins. the bet can be left for the next deal or can be withdrawn.
A Black Jack is paid 3 to 2 except in the event of a tie with the dealer. If no one has a Black Jack the count nearest to 21 wins.
